## Lunar New Year: Tradition, Vegas Style

Las Vegas is doing Lunar New Year like only Vegas can: dragon dances, lantern parades, and more red than a roulette table. The Venetian Resort is going full spectacle with lion and dragon dances, festive décor, and specialty eats. Downtown Summerlin is pulling out the stops, too — their parade kicks off at 6pm with a sea of lanterns and enough noise to wake the ancestors. Every corner seems to have a Lunar menu: check the [Las Vegas Magazine rundown](https://lasvegasmagazine.com/entertainment/2026/feb/16/las-vegas-lunar-new-year-celebrations-dining/) for dining specials, from dim sum to high-roller banquets.

Want receipts? [@LesleyinVegas](https://x.com/LesleyinVegas/status/2023775617574146407) is catching it all live — lion dances, crowds, and the occasional confused tourist. Venetian’s own event calendar spells out performance times and even the menu for their Lunar pop-up. Word is, Downtown Summerlin has family-friendly activities that don’t involve losing your mortgage. If you miss the parade, catch the festival glow — those lanterns stay up all week.

## Supper Clubs: Evolving, Weird, and Delicious

Vegas supper clubs are ditching old-school for immersive chaos. The [Mayfair Supper Club](https://lasvegasweekly.com/dining/2026/feb/12/mayfair-supper-clubs-new-chapter-blends-cuisine-sp/) is morphing into a hybrid beast: part supper club, part theater, part social playland. Expect live acts, unpredictable performances, and food worth Instagramming — or at least eating. According to [Las Vegas Weekly](https://lasvegasweekly.com/dining/2026/feb/12/mayfair-supper-clubs-new-chapter-blends-cuisine-sp/), this isn’t just dinner with a show; it’s dinner as a show, with new menus and vibe shifts nightly.

Over at [Vegas Distillery](https://x.com/vegasdistillery/status/2023817755900702989), they’re handing out free Cuban black beans and rice dinners on Feb 18. Yes, free. No, you don’t need a password — just show up. Want high-profile openings? The buzz is deafening: a famed Mexico City restaurant is finally landing on the Strip. [Review-Journal](https://neon.reviewjournal.com/dining-out/famed-cdmx-restaurant-finally-sets-opening-date-on-vegas-strip-3329359/) has the scoop on the official opening date, and the hype is real (for once). Family-style dinners, midweek deals, and immersive entertainment — Vegas is making supper clubs the new fever dream.

## Nightclub & DJ Madness: TAO’s Worship Thursdays

TAO is back in the headlines, and apparently, Thursdays are the new Saturdays. [Mike Attack](https://www.vegasful.com/events/fa59058d-8932-4794-b470-71a926ca6a3e) is headlining Worship Thursdays, turning TAO’s multi-level dance fortress into an electronic playground. The [official TAO calendar](https://taolasvegas.com/calendar/) lays out the lineup, but the real story is the crowd: diehards, party tourists, and half the city’s influencers. DJ Crespo is set to take over Memorial Day Weekend, and the buzz is already building. The [advance event page](https://www.vegasful.com/events/fa59058d-8932-4794-b470-71a926ca6a3e) promises Asian-inspired beats and spectacle — it’s TAO, so expect bottle service and drama.

Want more? [Vegasful](https://x.com/vegasful/status/2023848320775659562) is tracking every set, every guest list, and every “surprise” appearance. If you want to get in, [TAO’s ticket portal](https://taolasvegas.com/calendar/) is your best bet. Just don’t expect a quiet night.

## Rock ‘n’ Roll Running Festival: The Strip Gets Loud

Only in Vegas do marathoners get cheered by neon and EDM. The [Rock ‘n’ Roll Las Vegas Running Festival](https://www.runrocknroll.com/las-vegas) is back Feb 21-22, with CELSIUS sponsoring the madness. Races snake through the Strip and Downtown, so expect road closures, costume runners, and more selfie sticks than at a BTS concert. According to [@702_Events](https://x.com/702_Events/status/2023986838193496476), the festival isn’t just for runners — party-goers, live music fans, and anyone chasing that post-marathon glow are invited.

Event details and registration are live on the [official Rock ‘n’ Roll page](https://www.runrocknroll.com/las-vegas), where you’ll find maps, schedules, and the afterparty scoop. Las Vegas Weekly is also tracking which bars are opening early and which acts are playing the finish line. If you’re allergic to crowds, plan your escape. If you’re not, get your shoes and your playlist ready.

## Comedy & Live Performances: Laughs, Rock, and Charity

Vegas comedy is getting a shot of adrenaline. Martin Lawrence just announced a residency, and the energy is already off-the-charts. The [Vegasful event page](https://www.vegasful.com/events/06c302be-2928-4153-99cb-3ea9862c1cff) lists upcoming dates and ticket links, but don’t wait — Lawrence is packing houses, and the sets are fast, funny, and just a little bit wild.

Meanwhile, FireHOUSE is rocking the [Bel-Aire Lounge](https://www.vegas24seven.com/ignite-the-night-at-bel-aire-lounge-with-firehouse-a-night-dedicated-to-las-vegas-first-responders/) for a night dedicated to first responders. This isn’t your typical tribute — it’s a full-on rock show, and proceeds support local heroes. [Vegas24Seven](https://www.vegas24seven.com/ignite-the-night-at-bel-aire-lounge-with-firehouse-a-night-dedicated-to-las-vegas-first-responders/) has the details, and insiders are saying it’s one of the year’s better cause-driven gigs. Expect covers, originals, and a crowd that actually cares.

Wrap-up? Vegas isn’t just partying this week — it’s blending tradition, innovation, and a little bit of charity into one big, flashing, noisy, delicious spectacle. And that’s not hype, it’s just business as usual.
