Las Vegas never slows down, and this spring is shaping up to be one of the most exciting seasons for live entertainment in years.

## Residency Watch

Several major artists have announced new residencies at venues along the Strip. Whether you're into pop, rock, or comedy, there's something for everyone.

## Limited-Run Spectacles

Beyond the big-name residencies, several limited-run shows are making their Vegas debut. These are the ones you'll want to grab tickets for before they sell out.

## Where to Get Tickets

Pro tip: always check the venue box office directly — you'll often find better prices than third-party resellers.
