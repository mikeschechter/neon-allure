## Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Running Festival: The Strip Goes Sneakers-First

Ready to see thousands of runners turning the Strip into a neon-lit block party? The [Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Running Festival](https://www.runrocknroll.com/las-vegas) storms in February 21-22, with events that are basically a cardio-fueled parade. This isn’t your average 5K shuffle. Picture live bands, on-course DJs, afterparties, and the surreal experience of running down Las Vegas Boulevard with zero cars and all the chaos. Whether you’re jogging past the Bellagio Fountains or high-fiving strangers in Downtown, it’s peak Vegas energy. The festival markets itself as the [“world’s largest running party”](https://www.runrocknroll.com/las-vegas) for good reason. If you’re not running, just show up and soak in the spectacle. For a taste of the hype, check out [@702_Events’ coverage](https://x.com/702_Events/status/2023986838193496476) and the festival’s [official Twitter](https://x.com/702_Events/status/2024210231731920999).

## Rugby Pre-Game March and Party: Bulldogs, Dragons, and a Side of Vegas Weird

Rugby and Vegas are a match made in “did that just happen?” The NRL’s Bulldogs vs. Dragons game at Allegiant Stadium gets a Vegas-style warmup on February 28. Fans are invited to a free march from the [House of Blues](https://www.houseofblues.com/lasvegas) at Mandalay Bay to the stadium starting at 1 PM. It’s open to everyone—no secret handshake required. Expect flags, chants, and Aussies trying to explain the rules of rugby to confused tourists. The party builds momentum for one of the biggest rugby events the city’s ever hosted. [House of Blues](https://x.com/HOBLasVegas/status/2024255400523014176) is ground zero for pre-game madness, so expect beers, music, and a lot of blue and red.

## Lunar New Year on the Strip: Dragons, Drums, and Good Fortune

The Venetian’s Grand Canal Shoppes are in full Lunar New Year mode with dragon dances, drums, and enough gold décor to make Scrooge McDuck jealous. These performances aren’t just for show—they’re meant to bring good luck and fortune, and in Vegas, who’s going to argue with a little extra luck? The [Grand Canal Shoppes](https://www.grandcanalshoppes.com/en/events/lunar-new-year.html) have a stacked schedule with traditional dances that wind through the cobblestone walkways and faux canals. It’s a rare chance to see centuries-old tradition crash headfirst into the Strip’s neon circus. Check the Venetian’s event page and [@Vegas](https://x.com/Vegas/status/2024566773438402976) for the latest times and photos.

## Omega Mart Anniversary: Five Years of Surreal Shopping

If you haven’t wandered through the wild fever dream that is [Omega Mart at AREA15](https://area15.com/experiences/omega-mart/), you’re missing a Vegas rite of passage. This February, the city declared February 18 as [“Omega Mart Day”](https://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/News/Blog/Detail/omega-mart-day-declared-in-las-vegas) to celebrate five years of this brain-melting art installation. Imagine a grocery store run by aliens on acid, then double it. The [fifth anniversary](https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/arts-culture/omega-mart-celebrates-5-years-in-las-vegas-3073114/) means special pop-up performances, interactive art, and general weirdness. AREA15 itself is [a creativity hub](https://area15.com/) that’s become a local favorite for immersive experiences. You can get a peek at the festivities via [@CityOfLasVegas](https://x.com/CityOfLasVegas/status/2024267359398010893) and the [official Omega Mart page](https://area15.com/experiences/omega-mart/).

## Live Music and Performances: This Week’s Lineup is Stacked

Vegas doesn’t do dull, and this week’s concert lineup proves it. [Marc Anthony](https://www.fontainebleaulasvegas.com/entertainment/events/marc-anthony/) drops the Latin heat at the new Fontainebleau, and Joan Jett & The Blackhearts are ready to [shred the House of Blues](https://www.houseofblues.com/lasvegas/EventDetail?tmeventid=G5eVZ9LQyFQZr&offerid=0).

Those feeling nostalgic should grab tickets for the Freestyle Explosion Throwback Jam at Orleans Arena, featuring ‘80s and ‘90s dance-pop legends. Want the full lowdown?

## Iconic Ongoing Shows and Experiences: The Classics Still Hit Hard

Some Vegas shows never lose their shine. Cirque du Soleil’s [O](https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/o) is still making jaws drop with aquatic acrobatics at Bellagio. The Absinthe tent outside Caesars Palace is serving up its usual mix of raunch, comedy, and circus stunts—just don’t bring grandma unless she’s got a sense of humor. Over at the [Sphere](https://www.thespherevegas.com/), the Sphere Experience is redefining “immersive.” Love a King of Pop? [MJ ONE](https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/michael-jackson-one) is still moonwalking strong at Mandalay Bay. And if you want close-up magic, Shin Lim at the Mirage is the real deal—no rabbits, just mind-blowing sleight of hand. For a full rundown, check out coverage from [@prvegas](https://x.com/prvegas/status/2023938282300858739) and dig into the official show sites.

## Dining Spotlights: Steaks, Pasta, and Downtown Shakeups

March Madness is around the corner, and Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is already cashing in with promos on prime steaks and house-made pasta—because nothing says “sports fan” like a filet mignon after your bracket gets busted. The hype is real for their [March Madness specials](https://x.com/AndiamoLV/status/2024197382578065608), so book early. Downtown’s dining scene is also in flux, with [a new restaurant moving into the old 7th & Carson spot](https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/food/new-restaurant-to-replace-7th-carson-downtown-las-vegas-3072726/). The turnover doesn’t surprise anyone—Vegas eats its own, but sometimes the replacements are even tastier. For a pulse on what’s opening, closing, or just worth the calories, [Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://x.com/reviewjournal/status/2023910583855104005) keeps tabs on the latest.

## Community and Neighborhood Events: Jackson Avenue’s Revitalization Fest

It’s not all glitz—sometimes the best Vegas events happen off the tourist trail. The [Jackson Avenue Revitalization Festival](https://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Residents/Events/Detail/jackson-avenue-revitalization-festival) on February 21 throws the spotlight on the Historic Westside, with live entertainment, a farmers market, and a car and motorcycle show. It runs noon to 3 PM and it’s free, so you can save your cash for something flashier later. This one’s got a family-friendly, neighborhood vibe—the kind that’s getting rarer as the Strip sprawls out. [@CityOfLasVegas](https://x.com/CityOfLasVegas/status/2024305257912668612) has more details and updates.
